# Regression coverage for the heredoc-in-command-substitution parse bug (issues
# #166, #958, #1069). Building a variable with `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)` is
# unsafe on Bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash): the lexer scans for the matching `)` of
# the command substitution textually and tracks quote state through the heredoc
# body, so a single apostrophe, unbalanced quote, or unbalanced paren anywhere
# in that body breaks parsing of the *entire rest of the script* - `bash -n`
# fails, not just the generated brief. The DOD and Herdr-section builders now
# use `IFS= read -r -d '' VAR <<EOF || true` instead, which removes the `$(...)`
# wrapper and eliminates the whole defect class regardless of future prose.
# Ambient `bash -n` here is Bash 5 and cannot see the bug, so the real
# cross-version enforcement lives in the macos-stock-bash CI job.
